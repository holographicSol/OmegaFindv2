todo:

* create various levels of verbosity.

* fully utilize unoconv for mass/single file conversions. omega_find --> convert

* fully utilize unoconv for cats. (cat all the things). omega_find --> cat

* fully utilize patool for extraction compatibilities. omega_find --> extract

* permission scans

* potentially include mass encryption/decryption however it could be easily used a ransomware tool.

* ensure expected yield for each type of scan. run and step through each async/non-async scan code while analyzing
  results output for any missed results.

* ensure all sorting is optimized and produces expected results.

* pass all table headers through tabulate helper pad/newline function.

* sanitize all input

* expand on contents scan filters and compatibility.

* naturally as is, learning becomes progressively slower as the database grows.
    This is because each magic-buffer to suffix association is compared to every suffix/magic buffer in
    the database, as the database grows, comparison time increases.
    Find a solution.
